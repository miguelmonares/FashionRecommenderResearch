# FashionRecommenderResearch

In this project, we build a fashion recommender system built on visual features.

Our project is built on Visual Bayesian Personalized Ranking and uses explicit and implicit (aesthetic) features to learn user preferences.

Our architecture takes inspiration from the following paper:

>Wenhui Yu, Huidi Zhang, Xiangnan He, Xu Chen, Li Xiong, and Zheng Qin. 2018. Aesthetic-based Clothing Recommendation. In Proceedings of the 2018 World Wide Web Conference (WWW '18). International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee, Republic and Canton of Geneva, CHE, 649â€“658. https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186146

This project was built by a team of researchers: Miguel Monares, Evan Hong, Barry Xue, and William Luu. 

This project was advised by Dr. Julian McAuley.
